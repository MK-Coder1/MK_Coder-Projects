## 🚀 Intermediate Web Development Projects – From Practice to Craft

In the old traditions of learning, the student was not praised when he began, but when his hands grew steady and his mind learned rhythm. These intermediate projects mark that very moment in my journey — when basics matured into confidence, and curiosity turned into capability.

This repository is the next step forward from beginner exercises. Here, ideas breathe deeper, logic grows stronger, and design begins to matter as much as functionality.

If beginner projects teach you how to walk, intermediate projects teach you how to walk with purpose.
